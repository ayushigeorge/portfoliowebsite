            <h2>Interview Experience of MLH Fellow Program!</h2>
            <p>
              Greetings, my name is Ayushi George and I am pursuing my Bachelor
              of Technology in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. In the
              month of May, I applied for the MLH Fellow program 2022, which is
              a paid internship opportunity having international working
              exposure. MLH or Major Hacking League is known for its community
              building and elite Hackathons conduction.<br />
              I have attended Global Hack Day, Local Hack Day, Global Init, etc.
              events which were hosted and moderated by MLH fellows and thus was
              interested in being one. ,<br />
